# Stack Automate Tasks for Ruby on Rails

Can split an stack for automate tasks in Ruby on Rails:

-   Tests
-   Code Quality
-   Deploy
-   Monitoring

## Tests

-   rspec
-   factorybot
-   VCR
-   Knapsack

### Rspec

The [Rspec](https://rspec.info) Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby. Making TDD Productive and Fun.

See [documentation](https://rspec.info/documentation/).

### Factorybot

The FactoryBot is a widely used tool in the development of Ruby on Rails applications, because it allows prototyping model instances of your system with all of them as necessary features for testing.

See [documentation](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot#documentation)

### VCR

### Knapsack

## Code Quality

-   simplecov
-   rubocop
-   reek
-   breakman

### simplecov

SimpleCov is a code coverage analysis tool for Ruby. It uses Ruby's built-in Coverage library to gather code coverage data, but makes processing its results much easier by providing a clean API to filter, group, merge, format, and display those results, giving you a complete code coverage suite that can be set up with just a couple lines of code. SimpleCov/Coverage track covered ruby code, gathering coverage for common templating solutions like erb, slim and haml is not supported.

See [documentation](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov#getting-started)

### breakman

Brakeman is a static analysis tool which checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities.
